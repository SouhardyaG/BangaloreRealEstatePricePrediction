This data science project  to build a real estate price prediction model. 
We have built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

During model building we have used data science concepts such as
    data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
    
    
    
Technology and tool used in this::

  Python
  Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
  Matplotlib for data visualization
  Sklearn for model building
  Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
